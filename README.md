RealRandomDicewarePassGen
=========================

A Real random Diceware password generator using Random.org atmospheric noise random number generator. It's a python script 
that queries the numbers using a HTTP request and reads the diceware file in the root directory. More information on 
why this is a true (rather than pseudo-random) random number (and thus diceware) generator is provided on the Random.org
website (http://www.random.org/faq/#S2)
